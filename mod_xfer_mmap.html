<h2><b>ProFTPD module <code>mod_xfer_mmap</code></b></h2>
</center>
<hr><br>

<p>
The <code>mod_xfer_mmap</code> module was designed to improve the
performance of downloads by using the <code>mmap()</code> function to
map the file being downloaded into memory, and read directly from there,
saving on system calls and buffer copies.  The <code>mmap()</code> system call
is available on most modern Unix derivates, but not on all.  There are
sometimes system-specific limits on the size and number of files that can be
<code>mmap()</code>d; experimentation is probably the easiest way to find out.

<p>
The <code>mod_xfer_mmap</code> module can also create a list of statically
configured files (via <code>TransferMMapFile</code> directives in the main
server configuration) into memory.  This <code>mmap()</code>ing is done only at
server start or restart.  So whenever one of the mapped files changes on the
filesystem, you <b>must</b> restart the server (by sending it the
<code>HUP</code> signal).  To reiterate that point: if the files are modified
in place <i>without</i> restarting the server you may end up serving stale
data. You should update files by unlinking the old copy and putting a new copy
in place.  Most tools such as <code>rdist</code> and <code>mv</code> do this.
The reason why this modules doesn't take care of changes to the files is that
doing so would need an extra <code>stat()</code> every time, which is
wasteful and against the intent of I/O reduction.

<p>
This module is contained in the <code>mod_xfer_mmap.c</code> file for
ProFTPD 1.3.x, and is not compiled by default.  Installation instructions
are discussed <a href="#Installation">here</a>.

<h3><a name="TransferMMapEngine">TransferMMapEngine</a></h3>
<strong>Syntax:</strong> TransferMMapEngine <em>on|off</em><br>
<strong>Default:</strong> off<br>
<strong>Context:</strong> server config, &lt;VirtualHost&gt;, &lt;Global&gt;<br>
<strong>Module:</strong> mod_xfer_mmap<br>
<strong>Compatibility:</strong> 1.2.10rc1

<p>
The <code>TransferMMapEngine</code> directive enables or disables the module's
runtime mapping of files being downloaded.  Note that if <em>off</em>,
any files mapped via <code>TransferMMapFile</code> will be unmapped when the
FTP session starts.  Thus the daemon process will have mapped memory that
is not used by session processes, which is not an efficient configuration.

<p>
<hr>
<h3><a name="TransferMMapFile">TransferMMapFile</a></h3>
<strong>Syntax:</strong> TransferMMapFile <em>path1 [path2 path3 ...]</em><br>
<strong>Default:</strong> None<br>
<strong>Context:</strong> server config, &lt;VirtualHost&gt;, &lt;Global&gt;<br>
<strong>Module:</strong> mod_xfer_mmap<br>
<strong>Compatibility:</strong> 1.2.10rc1

<p>
The <code>TransferMMapFile</code> directive is used to &quot;preload&quot;
files into memory by mmapping them at startup time, rather than just before
the file is downloaded.  They will be automatically unmapped when the server
shuts down.  When these mapped files have changed, you should restart the
server to re-map them.

<h2><a name="Installation">Installation</a></h2>
To install <code>mod_xfer_mmap</code>, copy the <code>mod_xfer_mmap.c</code>
file into:
<pre>
  <i>proftpd-dir</i>/contrib/
</pre>
after unpacking the latest proftpd-1.3.x source code.  For including
<code>mod_xfer_mmap</code> as a staticly linked module, use:
<pre>
  $ ./configure --with-modules=mod_xfer_mmap
</pre>
To build <code>mod_xfer_mmap</code> as a DSO module:
<pre>
  $ ./configure --with-shared=mod_xfer_mmap
</pre>
Then follow the usual steps for using third-party modules in ProFTPD:
<pre>
  $ make
  $ make install
</pre>

<h2><a name="Usage">Usage</a></h2>
There are a couple of things to keep in mind when using
<code>mod_xfer_mmap</code>.  It only affects downloads from the server, not
uploads to the server.  If your <code>proftpd</code> uses
<code>sendfile()</code>, that function will take precedence over
<code>mod_xfer_mmap</code>.  Files that are handled by
<code>mod_xfer_mmap</code> can still be throttled by the
<code>TransferRate</code> and modules like <code>mod_shaper</code>.

<p>
<code>mod_xfer_mmap</code> will not handle a file if the file is larger
than <code>mmap()</code> can handle (which is around 2GB, depending on
your platform's implementation), or if the file is to transfered as an
ASCII file.

<p>
Example configuration:
<pre>
  &lt;IfModule mod_xfer_mmap.c&gt;
    TransferMMapEngine on
  &lt;/IfModule&gt;
</pre>

<p>
Note that you may see the size of session processes changing strangely;
this will happen as <code>mod_xfer_mmap</code> maps and unmaps files
from the process' memory space.
